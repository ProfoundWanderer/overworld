# Navbar

### Description

The navbar helps users navigate the website \(duh!\). It displays Overworld's logo, links to the `Games`, `Lists` and `People` sections \( ðŸš§ which are still under construction! ðŸš§\) and a button for signing in. Once you sign in a dropdown menu with your username will appear, which contains links to your profile and other stuff related to you. You can also log out from this drop down.
