# Footer

### Description

A simple `footer` component. It provides links to important/informative places in Overworld. 

### Usage

Use it like any other component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Footer } from "./modules/app/components/";

class Gitbook extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return (
            // Other content
            <Footer />
        );
    }
}

```

It's a footer, make sure it sits at the bottom of page!
